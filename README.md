# Public Address, Script Address, and Private Key (secret key) Prefix Calculator

This tool is designed for developers and hobby blockchain enthusiasts creating apps that need to generate public addresses, script addresses, and private keys. It can sometimes help shortcut updating existing open source libraries to utilize a new coin and parameter. 

All information entered into the prefix calculator is used in the user's browser. However, users should download and review the code to vet its security or viability. You can download the `index.html` file, save it to your desktop, and run it offline if needed.

## Usage

Enter a public key address, a script address, or a private key to calculate the respective hexadecimal and decimal prefixes.

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Enter the required information in the respective input fields.
3. Click the "Calculate Prefixes" button to view the results.

## Notes

All crucial calculations are performed locally on your browser. If you prefer, you can download the application and run it on your local computer. As always, please inspect the tool thoroughly before use. This tool is primarily intended for development or hobby coding purposes. It was created to save time and effort while generating address prefixes for key generation instead of manually searching through chainparams.
